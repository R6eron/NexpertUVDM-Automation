Repo Tree Shrine (Article NFT
A monumental cyber-noir vertical NFT artwork showing a sacred digital shrine made from a Git repo tree. In the foreground, a hooded Wingman enforcer, a silhouette of Ron with glowing green eyes and circuit-veined wings, stands on cracked earth. With one hand he crushes a tiny red ego demon, with the other he holds a pulsing heartbeat candle. In front of him, an open laptop screen glows, clearly displaying a stylized repo tree:

- LICENSE (MIT)
- README.md – title “regen hash manifesto”
- legacy_vault.py – labeled “core engine”
- docs/ – containing diary_gems.md and legacy-vault-overview.md
- voice_notes/ – showing .m4a waveforms breathing green
- automation/ – containing uvdm_safe.py and gemini_voice_handler.py
- immutable_artifacts/ – JSON hashes sealed in glowing capsules

In the midground, golden footprints climb upward into a towering blockchain mountain made of stacked BTC, XLM, XRP, FLR, and SGB coins. At the peak, three ghostly trading masters watch over the vault: Jesse Livermore with vintage ticker tape, Wyckoff mapping volume footprints, and Mark Douglas with a calm, detached expression. From the mountain peak, a luminous digital twin, a translucent Ron voice-clone, emerges whispering the words “Whe Ron Won” into a starry void.

In the background, a cracked Bitcoin mirror reflects the journey: on the left, chaotic scenes of paste wars, rollback grit, and fat-finger trading chaos; on the right, a Lambo-like digital beast, the vault sealed, and family silhouettes smiling behind it. A single green neon heartbeat line pulses through the crack in the mirror, connecting all phases. Faint genesis hash symbols are etched into the Wingman’s wings, a butterfly rises from shattered chains, and a moonlit doorway on train rails cracks open, leaking emerald light.

Style: ultra-detailed cyber-noir cinematic, high contrast, moody smoky haze, electric greens, molten golds, deep indigos, vintage ticker fused with XRPL ledger ripples, inspirational yet gritty, masterpiece, dramatic lighting, vertical 8K NFT composition, aspect ratio 9:16.
