Full Code: Upload the manuscript's sample script (pg. 92) as xlm_price_checker.py.
Demo: GIF/screenshot of a simulated run (e.g., alerting at $1 XLM trigger
uvdm_steps.py: Implement the 8-step harvesting table (pg. 28-29) as a function that simulates swaps (e.g., input: 108K XLM; output: yield projections to $60K).
.gitignore: Exclude API keys/secrets.

# Nexpert/UVDM-UVDM-Automation-
